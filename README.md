🛠️ AWS CLI Generator MCP – Phase 1 (Local)

This project is a Modular Command Parser (MCP) server that converts natural language (NLP) into AWS CLI commands, designed for cloud support engineers, developers, and DevOps practitioners.
Phase 1 is focused on local development:

✅ Modular parsers for S3, EC2, IAM, DynamoDB, API Gateway

✅ Flask server to serve an API (/mcp/generate-cli)

✅ CLI client (scripts/mcp_cli_client.py) for interactive local testing

✅ Web frontend (web/index.html, web/styles.css, web/script.js) for live demo

✅ Unit tests per parser with pytest

✅ Dark mode toggle for better UI experience

⚡ This is Phase 1 (Local-only). Future phases will expand to serverless AWS deployment and Marketplace readiness.
